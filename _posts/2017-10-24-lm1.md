### Linear Model
> We use linear models to ask how various predictors affect, or to what extent a set of predictors can explain, a **numeric response**. The goal of linear modeling is to be able to predict the numeric response from explanatory variables.

### Logistic Regression
> We use logistic regression models to ask how well various predictors can predict a **binary outcome** (i.e. healthy or diseased).
